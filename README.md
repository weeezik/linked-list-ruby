## Linked List Project
Building a linked list data structure using Ruby.

### Instructions
You will need two classes:

LinkedList class, which will represent the full list.
Node class, containing two instance variables, #value and #next_node, set both as nil by default.
Build the following methods in your linked list class:

#append(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
#prepend(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
#size returns the total number of nodes in the list
#head returns the first node in the list
#tail returns the last node in the list
#at(index) returns the node at the given index
#pop removes the last element from the list
#contains?(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
#find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.
#to_s represent your LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console. The format should be: ( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil
